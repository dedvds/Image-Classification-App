### Why an image classifier app?

In this tutorial, you will upload your images to the cloud, label your images to classify the data and train a model to recognize the categories. You will then connect your model to a PowerApp. This way, you can upload a picture to your app and it will tell you what it sees. 

Note! Before you start, make sure you a have a file with your pictures, access to the Azure portal and PowerApps (through an Office 365 environment).
